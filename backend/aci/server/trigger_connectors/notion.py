NOTION WEBHOOK MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED

To complete your Notion webhook setup:

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Select your integration (or create one if needed)
3. Navigate to the "Webhooks" tab
4. Click "Add webhook subscription"
5. Enter this webhook URL:
   {webhook_url}

6. Notion will send a verification POST request to your URL
7. The request will contain a verification_token in the body
8. Save this verification token: {verification_token}
9. Go back to Notion and click "⚠️ Verify"
10. Paste the verification token and click "Verify subscription"

11. Select event types to monitor:
    - Recommended: {trigger_type}
    - You can add more event types as needed

12. Configure event filters (optional):
    - Choose specific databases or pages to monitor
    - Or monitor all content shared with your integration

13. Save and activate the webhook

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Your webhook must be publicly accessible (HTTPS required)
- The integration must have access to pages/databases you want to monitor
- Events are delivered within 5 minutes
- Some events (like page.content_updated) are aggregated to reduce noise
