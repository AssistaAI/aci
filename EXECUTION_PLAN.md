# Trigger/Webhook System - Execution Plan

**Status**: üöß In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-10

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Pull Model First**: Starting with polling (GET /v1/trigger-events) instead of push callbacks to clients. Simpler, more reliable.
- **Per-App Connectors**: Each app gets its own trigger connector due to vastly different webhook mechanisms.
- **Event Retention**: 30-day automatic cleanup to manage database growth.
- **Status Enum**: Using string for flexibility (can add new statuses without migration).

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we support webhook retries from third-party services?
- [ ] What's the max event retention period?
- [ ] Do we need priority queues for high-volume apps?
- [ ] Should triggers.json be seeded into database or loaded dynamically?

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Gmail Pub/Sub complexity delays Phase 4
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler webhook apps, Gmail is optional advanced feature
- **Risk**: Webhook volume overwhelms database
  - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting, aggressive cleanup, consider TimescaleDB
- **Risk**: Third-party API changes break connectors
  - **Mitigation**: Version trigger definitions, maintain backwards compatibility
